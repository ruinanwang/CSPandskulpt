Presenting your Innovation
====================

.. index:: Global Impact


Writing about your Innovation
--------
Use your outline to write responses to the content requirements listed in the `AP CS Principles Guidelines <http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-principles-performance-assessment.pdf>`_.

Creating a Visual Artifact
--------
You will also create a visual of the innovation you choose to explore, highlighting a beneficial or harmful effect. This aspect will deepen your understanding of the innovation while leveraging your computer skills. When deciding what to create, consider your list of beneficial and harmful effects from your outline. Which one could be demonstrated through a movie or infographic? Additionally, what resources and tools do you need to create such an artifact? Do you already know how to use iMovie or Adobe Photoshop? Are you interested in learning how to create an app prototype using Fluid UI? No matter what do you decide, keep in mind you only have 8 hours to accomplish the task on the exam. Your creation should be thorough yet efficient.
